Airbnb Snooze
--------------------

On Amazon AWS Ubuntu image:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgtk2.0-0 libgconf-2-4 libnotify4 libasound2 libxtst6 libxss1 libnss3 xvfb
```

Get an account at [postmark](https://postmarkapp.com) and register with an email (this is to notify you if a snooze or relisting fails)

Create a `config.json`
```
{
	"email": "your-airbnb-email@domain.com",
	"password": "your-airbnb-password",
	"postmark_email": "your-postmark-email",
	"postmark_api": "your-postmark-api-key"
}
```

Create a cron job
```bash
crontab -e
```

then write
```
0 16 * * * xvfb-run /home/ubuntu/airbnb-snoozer/index.js -s
0 1 * * * xvfb-run /home/ubuntu/airbnb-snoozer/index.js
```

check that it's running after a while with
```bash
grep cron /var/log/syslog
```

### Troubleshooting

Try running `DEBUG=* xvfb-run /home/ubuntu/airbnb-snoozer/index.js -s` on the server and see if it works.

If it doesn't seem to be doing anything (ie. it's just queued and not going to the webpage) try this and see if there is anything missing.

```bash
cd node_modules/nightmare/node_modules/electron-prebuilt/dist
ldd electron | grep â€˜not found'
```
On OSX you can use the `-d` parameter to show the window as it's working.
